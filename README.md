# Solarized Themes for Notepad++ AHK & Markdown

I'm a avid user of the [Solarized Color Scheme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). However, the Autohotkey (AHK) user defined language (UDL) I first started using wasn't solarized and neither was AutoHotKey (AHK). This is my attempt to fix that. I hope you found this useful.


## Installation Instructions
1. Download **userDefineLang.xml** files below (as raw)
2. Make sure to close Notepad++
3. Save the xml(s) to the Notepad++\userDefineLangs subfolder, on Windows this is likely `\%appdata%\Notepad++\userDefineLangs`
4. Open Notepad++ and you should see the new languages at the bottom of the Language Menu
5. `Restart` Notepad++
